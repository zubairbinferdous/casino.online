            <h2>What is a Casino Deposit Method?</h2>
            <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []" class="text-center">A casino payment method is <strong>how you deposit money into
                    the casino</strong>. Players at online casinos need to “buy chips”, so to speak, before they can
                place bets on <a href="https://casino.online/games/">online casino games</a>. <strong>The process where
                    you add money to your online casino profile that you can then wager is called a “deposit”</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">In physical casinos, the deposit methods are usually fairly limited - you can use
                cash or a debit/credit card.<strong> Online, however, you can deposit using a very wide range of other
                    payment methods</strong>. The sheer number of payment methods can be very confusing to newcomers,
                which is why it’s best to examine each in detail and make an informed decision based on that
                information.</p>

                <h2>The Best Online Casino Payment Methods</h2>
                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;" class="text-center"><strong>The most common online casino payment
                        methods are debit cards and e-wallets.</strong> Debit cards are something that most of us have
                    already, so it makes sense that most people would rather deposit just with their Visa or MasterCard.
                    With that said, e-wallets provide gamblers with better security and flexibility than cards, which is
                    why they've started to gain some traction in recent years. Services like PayPal, Skrill and Neteller
                    won't replace debit cards at the number one spot any time soon, but they're gaining ground towards
                    that objective with each passing year.</p>
                <p class="text-center">But even beyond that, <strong>there are other casino payment methods that are
                        worth taking note of</strong>. It is good to be aware of them all, so be sure to take a closer
                    look at the best casino payment methods listed below:</p>

                                cards are significantly more convenient than cash when it comes to purchases - you don't
                                need to worry about loose notes or heavy coins, or about having the cash to pay for
                                something, as your entire bank account is with you wherever you go!</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Depositing money into your online casino account with a debit card
                                isn't that much different from using them to buy anything else online. After a brief
                                check-in with your bank to authorize the transaction the amount will be made available
                                for you to use for betting and the money will be removed from your bank . While very
                                convenient, this payment method is considered unsafe, as giving your debit card details
                                online leaves you vulnerable to identity theft and fraud.</p>

                                is one of the world's most popular e-wallets. After being bought by eBay and used as its
                                primary check-out platform, millions of people across the world found themselves
                                creating a PayPal account to purchase from their favourite auction website. And while
                                PayPal is no longer associated with eBay, its popularity and name recognition have both
                                remained on top.</p>

                                linking it directly. As such, PayPal most often acts as an intermediary between
                                traditional banks and online casino accounts, handling the payment securely and
                                providing minimal information to the casino to minimize the risk of fraud or identity

                                    href="https://casino.online/payments/skrill/">Skrill</a> is undoubtedly the king of
                                online casinos - it's almost impossible to find a casino in the UK (or even globally)
                                which doesn't accept deposits via Skrill. In practice, this e-wallet solution works very
                                similarly to PayPal, though with some clear advantages: besides its very wide
                                availability, Skrill also sports lower fees during withdrawal and faster, less demanding
                                account verification process.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">It does have its drawbacks too, of course - namely that its
                                transaction processing time is a bit slower. While PayPal processes its transactions
                                between 0 and 2 hours, Skrill can at times take up to 24 hours to fully process.</p>

                                Skrill and Neteller are very similar, but not for the reasons you may think - back in
                                2015,<a href="https://casino.online/payments/neteller/"> Neteller</a> purchased Skrill,
                                yet kept it as a separate payment method instead of absorbing it within itself. As such,
                                the two have become extremely similar, sporting the same benefits (high availability and
                                low fees) and the same shortcomings. It's important to note that Neteller's fees are
                                slightly higher than Skrill's.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">While Skrill is more popular than Neteller overall, and we feel more
                                comfortable recommending Skrill due to its lower fees, either one of them is a great way
                                to deposit into an online casino.</p>

                                was created online and exists online, without any kind of physical equivalent!</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Bitcoin wasn't the first such "cryptocurrency", but it's certainly
                                the first one which gained major traction, and that traction hasn't slowed down! Once

                                online casinos in the UK. However, some will happily take a Bitcoin deposit, and we've
                                seen casinos that exclusively deal in crypto.</p>

                        fact that most banks today will automatically issue you one alongside your account, allowing you
                        to withdraw funds from it at ATMs or use them for in-store purchases.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">The fact that <strong>you can use your debit card online even without having

                card. Barring a select few , practically every online casino will accept your card, making it a good
                choice if you're not entirely sure which casino you'd like to play at.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Of course, the fact that you don't need your card with you, just the information from
                it, to make purchases, <strong>carries a certain danger</strong> - what if someone besides you were to
                find out your card information and use it to pay for things? As such, it's always a good idea to
                thoroughly vet the casino before providing them with your card information.</p>

                            may remember using your credit cards for your deposits. Unfortunately, those nostalgic old
                            days are long gone, and <strong>as of April 2020 it is no longer possible to use a credit
                                card to deposit at online casinos</strong>.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">There are many reasons why this decision was made, but one of the main
                            reasons is that<strong> it was too easy for people suffering from gambling addiction to go
                                into debt by betting money they didn't really have</strong>.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">Another major reason was that <strong>casinos were a prime target for scams
                                committed with stolen credit cards</strong>, where a scammer would deposit a large sum
                            with a credit card, then withdraw it into a debit card or an e-wallet, stealing the money.
                            With that in mind, casinos now only accept debit cards and other solutions that rely on
                            money you already possess rather than bank debt.</p>

                    service (such as Neteller) it could be a MasterCard.</p>
                <p class="text-center">The next logical question is: <strong>What's the difference as far as online
                        casino deposits are concerned?</strong> The two companies encrypt customer data in different
                    ways and offer different reward schemes, but beyond that, they <strong>both function completely

                    <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []" class="text-left">An e-wallet is exactly what it sounds like - an entirely
                        online wallet. Just like your real wallet, an e-wallet will let you keep money in it, similarly,
                        <strong>your e-wallet can also hold your debit card information</strong>! Don't have a card, but
                        have a bank account? No worries - most e-wallet solutions will let you link your account
                        directly.
                    </p>
                    <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []" class="text-left">While it may sound unsafe to give some company like
                        PayPal or Neteller access to your banking account,<strong> in reality, it's much safer to
                            deposit using an e-wallet service than straight with your debit card</strong>. Debit card
                        transactions have their protections, naturally, but their design is inherently flawed, and if
                        the casino or an interested hacker grabs hold of your card details they can very easily use them
                        to make purchases for themselves or even drain your entire account!</p>

            <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []" class="text-center">Meanwhile, an e-wallet would act as an intermediary, only
                giving the casino access to the most important information (such as your name and the amount you're
                depositing) while <strong>encrypting everything else</strong>. This minimizes the chance of your card
                details being stolen to zero.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Of course, <strong>e-wallet solutions come with their own set of drawbacks</strong> -

                            absolutely can't be said about e-wallet payments, which, while providing the same basic
                            function, <strong>are very different when it comes to the details</strong>, and as such your
                            choice of service will vary greatly.</p>
                        <p class="text-center"><strong>PayPal may be the market leader in general</strong>, but in the
                            world of online casinos the clear victor is Skrill - since PayPal is very picky about which
                            companies it partners with, especially when it comes to adult activities like casino, very
                            few online casinos actually support it. If your casino of choice is supporting PayPal and
                            you already have a PayPal account then go ahead and use that! But if you're either unsure of
                            what casino to choose or haven't made an e-wallet account yet, <strong>then we recommend

                        <p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;" class="text-left">As we already briefly discussed in the
                            debit card section,<strong> cards are ultimately just a convenient tool that connects to
                                your banking account</strong>. After all, once upon a time making bank transactions was
                            considered big, serious, and scary - you had to go to the bank, fill out the sender and
                            recipient's accounts, and wait 48-72 hours for the transaction to clear. As such, debit
                            cards were invented to streamline that process and make bank transactions as easy as
                            inserting your card into a device and typing a 4-digit number.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">Today, <strong>account-to-account transactions with no card to serve as an
                                intermediary can be as simple as inputting some information into an online form and
                                clicking okay</strong>. It can often be as simple as just making a few taps within a
                            dedicated banking app!</p>
                        <p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;" class="text-left">The exact same principle can be applied to
                            depositing in <a href="https://casino.online/">online casinos</a>. Granted, debit cards are
                            and probably always will be the most popular way of making a deposit with your bank account
                            - but they're not the only way anymore. Many casinos now accept direct bank transfers from
                            your account without requiring any kind of intermediary<strong>.</strong> While there's no
                            real benefits to doing it as opposed to using a card (in fact, using some kind of
                            intermediary, like a card or an e-wallet, would be safer), it's a <strong>good enough option
                                for those who don't have a card or prefer not to use one.</strong></p>

                        transfer is actually one of the most complicated methods.</strong> While e-wallets let you
                    deposit with just one click, many casinos require a multi-step process in order to allow a deposit
                    via bank transfer. What further complicates things is that the deposit process may different
                    drastically from casino to casino, and even from bank to bank.</p>
                <p class="text-center">While bank transfers may sound like an appealing idea if you don't have a debit
                    card yet, it's only a practical payment method if you don't deposit more than a few times a year.
                    <strong>If you prefer to make more frequent, but smaller deposits, then you're better off simply
                        applying for a debit card</strong>, which is free at most banks and can be used almost
                    universally when paying for goods and services online.

                    dandy, but <strong>is it really a good idea to provide your banking information to third
                        parties</strong>? After all, even if you use a banking app (such as the mobile app of the bank
                    your account is registered with) you're still providing a ton of information to the casinos about
                    yourself. Some of that you'd already need to provide them with as part of your sign-up process, but
                    by using your bank account you'd be giving them much more than required.</p>
                <p class="text-center">As such, <strong>we highly recommend using an intermediary</strong> (such as a
                    debit card or an e-wallet) rather than performing a direct deposit with your bank account. It's more

                            Union and Trustly are very similar</strong>, as they have roughly similar fees and processes
                        by which you deposit. As such, the main deciding factor in which one you should use ultimately
                        boils down to just one thing - availability. Which of these banking deposits methods is more

                        gambling associations. As such,<strong> a large number of UK online casinos have chosen to
                            accept deposits sent to them via Western Union</strong>. We're not trying to say that
                        Trustly isn't accepted - in fact, if your casino of choice accepts it there's no real reason not

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []" class="text-center"><strong>Most banks today have a dedicated banking
                        app</strong> that you can use to manage your accounts, check your balance and your cards,
                    monitor transactions and even make bank transfers, all without ever leaving the comfort of your own

                        transfers from the app, can't you also deposit into an online casino</strong>?</p>
                <p class="text-center"><strong>The answer to that question lies entirely with the casino and how they
                        accept deposits.</strong> Some<a href="https://casino.online/new/"> new online casinos</a> will
                    just give you a bank account and tell you to send your deposit to that account, then match your bank
                    account information to your online casino account in order to manually add the money to it. Others,
                    however, have a more automatic process which requires using their own client. The former case should
                    be easy to handle with just your banking app, but the latter will require inputting your banking

                    debit cards with a set amount of money already deposited in</strong>. All you need to do is purchase
                a card from a shop, then input the code printed on it on the online casino deposit page and boom, the
                cash you paid for the card is suddenly in your account!</p>
            <p class="text-center">While not quite as convenient as debit cards and e-wallets, <strong>pre-paid cards
                    are extremely easy to use</strong>, as they don't require any kind of setup or account creation,
                just type in the code on the card and you're good to go. In addition, <strong>pre-paid cards are also
                    extremely secure</strong>, as unlike debit cards you're not sending any information to the casino or
                allowing it access to your payment details, minimizing the risk of fraud to zero.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Last, but certainly not least, <strong>pre-paid cards are a fantastic way to limit

                                to mention that if you're the type of person who would rather not bother with setting up
                                accounts, then going to the store and buying a pre-paid card is the easiest way to start
                                placing some bets!</p>

                    <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []" class="text-center">While Paysafecard and Cashtocode both involve
                        depositing using cash instead of an online solution (such as an e-wallet), the two of them could
                        not be more different, in no small part because <strong>Cashtocode isn't technically
                            "pre-paid"</strong>.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">With Paysafecard you purchase a card with a set amount of money in it, paying
                        that money in cash and then using it online. Meanwhile, <strong>paying with Cashtocode will
                            generate a code which you need to scan at a retailer partnered with Cashtocode where you can
                            pay in cash</strong>. As such, the transaction isn't really "pre-paid" - it's just that
                        you're using the store (and the banking institution Cashtocode works with) as an intermediary
                        rather than your own bank or e-wallet.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">With that said, <strong>we believe that Paysafecard is the better
                            option</strong>. It's more convenient to use, more retailers accept it and, in case your
                        gambling plans go through, you can always use your Paysafecard to buy something else.</p>

                <h2>The Specifics of Making Bitcoin Deposits</h2>
                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;" class="text-center">It has not taken long for online casinos to jump
                    onto the crypto bus and accept bitcoin as a payment method, with the first online casino to take
                    them opening back in the ancient times of 2014. Two years later, NetBet became the first UK casino
                    to accept bitcoin, though sadly until recently they were the only one. While <strong>Bitcoin is a
                        very popular payment method globally</strong>, here it remains relatively niche, with just a
                    small handful of <a href="https://casino.online/crypto-casinos/">crypto casinos</a> agreeing to
                    accept it - NetBet being the bgigest.</p>
                <p class="text-center">By far the biggest reason why people use Bitcoin is that <strong>it's incredibly
                        secure</strong>. Bitcoin wallets are practically uncrackable (you've probably heard stories of
                    people with millions' worth of Bitcoin on wallets they can't access because they forgot the
                    password) and <strong>absolutely no personal information is transmitted during a
                        transaction</strong>.</p>
                <p class="text-center"><strong>The big drawback is that there are no protections against scams
                        whatsoever.</strong> If you deposit at a casino using PayPal and they turn out to be fraudulent
                    you can probably get your deposit back, but with Bitcoin, once you send those coins they're gone
                    forever.</p>

                        it certainly wasn't the last. Since its inception, <strong>dozens of different cryptocurrencies
                            have been made available to both gamblers and general crypto enthusiasts</strong>. Of
                        course, none have seen anywhere near the level of success that Bitcoin has, but some have still
                        proven to be successful like Ethereum.</p>
                    <p class="text-left"><strong>Ethereum is probably the most popular cryptocurrency besides
                            Bitcoin</strong>, but it's important to remember that not all crypto that is valuable is
                        successful. Take, for example, Litecoin and Tether, both of which are very popular and widely
                        used in payment methods in no small part because they're much cheaper than Bitcoin.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="text-center"><strong>Depositing using Bitcoin is probably the most difficult payment method out of
                    all available</strong>, and so it's not recommended for newcomers to online casinos. This difficulty
                stems from the fact that online casinos that accept it have a different process of deposit, and that in
                turn is further changed and complicated by the Bitcoin wallet that you've chosen.</p>

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;" class="text-center">In theory - <strong>yes, quite a lot of them
                        do</strong>! Many of the big cryptocurrency casinos take deposits not only in Bitcoin, but also
                    in Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether, TRON and Cardano.</p>
                <p class="text-center">If you live in a different jurisdiction it may be possible to use a different
                    cryptocurrency to make your deposit, but if you live in the UK then your only choices are to either
                    use Bitcoin or wait until a casino starts accepting other currencies.</p>
